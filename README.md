This is a modified and ported version of Elecia White's command console. I release the modified code under the BSD-3-Clause license (see LICENSE file).

The original code is released in the public domain. You can find it here: [https://github.com/eleciawhite/reusable](https://github.com/eleciawhite/reusable)
And the original public domain LICENSE there: [LICENSE](https://github.com/eleciawhite/reusable/blob/master/LICENSE)

You can find her podcast at [http://embedded.fm](http://embedded.fm) and herself at [@logicalelegance](https://twitter.com/logicalelegance). I can highly recommend the podcast when you are interested in embedded development!
